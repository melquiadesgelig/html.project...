<h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>Founded by a team of passionate veterinary professionals and dog lovers, PETHOUSE VETERINARY CLINIC AND GROOMING CENTER was created out of a<br>
    deep commitment to promoting the health, happiness, and wellbeing of pets in our community. With years of experience in animal care and a<br>
    genuine love for dogs, we saw an opportunity to build a clinic where pets and their families receive not only expert medical attention but also<br>
    the personal care and compassion they deserve.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Our team is led by experienced veterinarians who specialize in both preventative and emergency care, ensuring that your dog's health is in<br>
    the best hands possible. We also offer professional grooming services that are tailored to the individual needs of your dog, keeping them looking<br>
    and feeling their very best. From routine check-ups to specialized treatments, and from basic baths to luxurious spa services, we're here to meet<br>
    your dog's needs at every stage of life.</p>

    Whether it's managing chronic health conditions, helping your dog through an illness, or simply maintaining their overall wellness, our goal is always to<br>
    enhance your dog's quality of life.</p>
    <br>
